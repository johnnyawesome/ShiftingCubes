A Cube, made out of little cubes that are shifting around

## Info

The Project is written in JavaScript, using the [P5JS library](https://p5js.org/).

All cubes are objects that move around on their own.

## Background

This was not my idea, all the credit goes to the YouTube-channel [RenderedByBlender](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwgRphtiLuhYVlEv_0sEdw) who posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7kdxLIwsIA).
He did it with blender and python, I made my own version in P5JS.

## More information

I blogged about this project [here](https://breaksome.tech/coding-shifting-cubes-in-p5js/).
